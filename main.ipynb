    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "This model is a recommender system for Steam games. It is based on the dataset from Steam, which is a digital distribution platform for video games. The dataset contains 316 games and 21 million users. The recommender system is based on collaborative filtering and content based model. The system integrates the recommender module and a user interaction module."

    "2. Extracting features from the game dataset, build feature vectors for games. The item vector is a hierarchical structure. First, for the description, use text vectorization technology (such as TF-IDF or Word2Vec) to process the description text of the game to generate a dense numerical vector for each game. Then perform one-hot encoding on tags. A comprehensive feature vector is formed by stacking the two types of encodings horizontally. For example, if the tag encoding is 1000 dimensions and the description vectorization is 200 dimensions, the comprehensive feature vector for each game will be 1200 dimensions."
